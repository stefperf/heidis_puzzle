# Heidi's puzzle


PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
--------------------
- Logical representation and brute-force solution for logical puzzles made up of collectively self-referential questions, as in the below example.
- Developed in Python 3.9.1.
- TO DO: build the additional functionality of automatically creating such puzzles.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
-----------------
Many thanks to my colleague Heidi Pang, because during our free time, she inspired this project by posing the sample puzzle, co-authored an earlier version of this code and, last but not least, managed to teach me something I did not know about Python.
It is great to have colleagues like her, always pushing me to improve!
